This is a list of what changed since the last release.

The non-SSE2 version is now non-SSE once more.  Some people have some
ancient computers out there.  

The Meta 7 viewer is really only for use in Meta 7, though it works well
in other open sims, it SHOULD NOT be used in Second Life.  Since we
don't care about the Second Life Third Party Viewer Policy, the Meta 7
no longer reports the private information concerning your computer that
Second Life insists on.  Second Life may ban people that use the Meta 7
viewer on Second Life.  So don't use it there.  We made this change to
protect your privacy.

Classified adverts don't work yet, as they are not supported be the
server side.  They do cost money though, so they have been disabled in
the viewer.

The maximum build height is now 65536 meters, 16 times the earlier 4096
meters.  The use of oxygen tanks when you are 65 kms up is encouraged.
